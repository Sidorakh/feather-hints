# feather-hints

A plugin for [GMEdit](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/GMEdit) that shows the same hints for functions that you would get when using Feather in the GameMaker IDE

# Installation instructions:
1. Create a folder named "feather-hints" in `%appdata%/AceGM/GMEdit/plugins` on Windows, or `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/AceGM/GMEdit/plugins` on Mac OS
2. Place the `main.js`, config.json` and `tooltip.css` files into this new folder
3. Launch GMEdit
4. Hover over an inbuilt function to check if it's running

# to-do

Would be nice to have hints for inbuilt constants, variables, structs, and enums but I can't do that easily down to how GMEdit works. I'll work it out at some point.
